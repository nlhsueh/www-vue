## First page
We will now learn how we can create our very first Vue web page, in 5 basic steps:

1. Start with a basic HTML file.
2. Add a <div> tag with id="app" for Vue to connect with.
3. Tell the browser how to handle Vue code by adding a `<script>` tag with a link to Vue.
4. Add a `<script>` tag with the Vue instance inside.
5. Connect the Vue instance to the <div id="app"> tag.



## Directive

Directive	Details
---
* `v-bind`	Connects an attribute in an HTML tag to a data variable inside the Vue instance. 連接 html 屬性與 Vue 實體。
* `v-if`	Creates HTML tags depending on a condition. Directives v-else-if and v-else are used together with the v-if directive. 
* `v-show`	Specifies if an HTML element should be visible or not depending on a condition.
* `v-for`	Creates a list of tags based on an array in the Vue instance using a for-loop.
* `v-on`	Connects an event on an HTML tag to a JavaScript expression or a Vue instance method. We can also define more specifically how our page should react to a certain event by using event-modifiers.
* `v-model`	Used in HTML forms with tags like `<form>`, `<input>` and `<button>`. Creates a two way binding between an input element and a Vue instance data property.
